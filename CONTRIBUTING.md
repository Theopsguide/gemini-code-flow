# Contributing to Gemini Code Flow 🚀

**Welcome!** Please help make this project better! 

## 🙏 Honest Truth: I Need Your Help!

**Hi, I'm Luke and I'm a total noob at this!** 😅 This project is my attempt to adapt [RuV's amazing Claude Code Flow](https://github.com/ruvnet/claude-code-flow) for Gemini CLI, but I'm definitely making mistakes and could use guidance from experienced developers.

### 🤷‍♂️ What I'm Probably Doing Wrong:
- **Code structure** - Is this organized properly?
- **TypeScript usage** - Am I following best practices?
- **Error handling** - I probably missed edge cases
- **Performance** - No clue if this is optimized
- **Testing** - What tests should I write?
- **Documentation** - Is it clear enough?

## 🙏 A Humble Request

**Please help make this project actually good!** 🚀✨

I'm putting this out there hoping that experienced developers will:
